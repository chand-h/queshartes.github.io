		<h1>Young Squirm, King Squish</h1>
		<p>
			Soundwaves from the hot new dynamic duo Squish and Squirm have been sweeping the nation at rates never before seen. Much credit is due to their extremely sophisticated, paradigm shifting instrumentation and lyricism, which has been proven to cure many diseases. From hit singles such as ‘Geeb Watahhh’ and ‘COVID FLOW’, to deep cuts such as ‘Bitches In My Civic’, fans can’t seem to get enough of their music. It is worth noting the duo have explicitly stated that their music is not for honkeys or crackers, despite their predominantly white demographic. Multiple charges have been filed against the duo and their security for forcing caucasian fans on stage and brutally assaulting them. To our relief however, their legal team was able to get the charges dropped. Bad news for those all those honkeys though, but they probably had it coming. Anyways, stay tuned to see Yung Squirm and King Squish save this dying world with their upcoming mixtape, which has yet to be named.
